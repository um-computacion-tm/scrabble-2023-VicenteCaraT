# Scrabble

Scrabble is a popular word game where players use letter tiles to create words on a game board. Each letter tile has a point value, and players earn points by forming words. The game involves strategic placement of words on the board to maximize points. Special squares on the board can multiply or increase the word or letter scores. Players use their vocabulary and word-forming skills to compete, making it a game that promotes language abilities and strategic thinking. Scrabble has been enjoyed by players of all ages since its creation in the 1930s.
